I have uploaded some previous simulations related to two-stage data, which include calculations of model evaluation metrics and parameter estimates under different two-stage sampling methods. Specifically, SAS represents simple random sampling, balance represents a balanced sampling method based on traditional variables, and Rbalance represents a balanced sampling method based on risk values. Additionally, we considered the model estimation and performance under scenarios where the two-stage variables are imbalanced.
